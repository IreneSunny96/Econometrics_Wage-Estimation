# Econometrics_Wage-Estimation

## Overview
The project provides a comprehensive analysis on the effect of education and experience on wages, including gender as a variable. It involves computing descriptive statistics, generating dummy variables for education levels, and estimating wage determination models through Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Generalized Least Squares (GLS) methods. 

Key aspects include examining the significance of educational levels, the impact of experience (and its square) on salary, interaction terms to explore gender differences in wage effects, and tests for heteroskedasticity and normality of residuals. The study concludes with adjustments for heteroskedasticity using Weighted Least Squares and testing the Gaussian distribution of errors, highlighting the robustness and implications of the econometric models used.

## Dataset
The dataset named bwages, comprises a cross-sectional dataset with 1,472 observations. Here are the key components of this dataset:

wage: The hourly wage rate in euros.
male: A binary variable indicating gender, where 1 represents male and 0 represents female.
educ: The education level, categorized into five levels:
1 for primary school
2 for lower vocational training
3 for intermediate level
4 for higher vocational training
5 for university level.
exper: The number of years of experience.
